# React Portfolio

## Description

An updated portfolio of my projects using the React platform.

## User Story

As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the portfolio then they are presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. When the user views the header,then they are presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

When the user views the navigation titles, they are then presented with the titles "About Me", "Portfolio", "Contact", and "Resume", and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.

When the user clicks on a navigation title they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted. Loading the portfolio for the the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default, with a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.

When the user clicks the Portfolio section they see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.

When the user clicks on the Contact section, they see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. The user moves their cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text and they will receive a notification that this field is required. If the user enters text into the email address field that is not in email address format, they will receive a notification they have entered an invalid email address.

When the user checks the Resume section, they see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.

When the user views the footer they are presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
